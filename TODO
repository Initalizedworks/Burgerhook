fix aimbot shooting through cart (and other parts of the map)
get all catbots to restart after 10 hours (prevents memory leaks)
I'm Done. Do whatever you like with the repos, update them as you like with them do whatever idc and ye I'm done for now. (Fuck my router.) My discord account that you currently have added will be terminated I am for now moving on to get better grades and
wanting to have a bearable life now, I feel everyday it just the same and repetitive, tearing down my sanity.
I rather stabilize my health rather than burgerhook, until nullworks comes with a patch.
I will contact you again, you can remove me on your repos idc.
